The International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) is an international organization that brings together Lodges bearing the name "Europe" and operating under the auspices of Regular Grand Lodges. The first symposium, where ISEL was founded, was held in Riccione from May 9 to 11, 2008. Six Lodges from Italy, Austria, France, and Romania gathered on the initiative of the Brethren from Lodge Europe No. 765 in the Orient of Riccione. In the following years, new Lodges from other European countries joined, so today ISEL comprises over 20 Lodges from Italy, Austria, France, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, and Montenegro. Every year around May 9, Europe Day, member Lodges and invited ones gather at the symposium in one of the member countries. The next meeting place and the Lodge to host will be selected during the symposium. 
Symposium topics are related to the fundamental values nurtured by Freemasonry, current social issues within the European continent, and the exchange of experiences in Lodgeâ€™s work to improve operations in the vibrant world of the 21st century. In May 2013, Lodge Europe hosted the sixth International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) when it unveiled the fountain "At the Rough Stone" at Cvetni Trg (Flower Square) in Belgrade.
