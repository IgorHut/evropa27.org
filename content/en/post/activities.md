Lodge Europe No. 27 in the Orient of Belgrade operates under the auspices of the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia and participates in many humanitarian activities within its parent organization. In addition, it regularly organizes several traditional activities carried out within the capabilities of its members on an annual basis. These include donations of clothing, food, hygiene products, medicines for the homeless and orphaned children, and books to local libraries in Belgrade and other places in Serbia. Lodge Europe also highlights that in May 2013, when it hosted the sixth International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL), it unveiled the fountain "At the Rough Stone" at Flower Square in Belgrade. This is the first official Masonic monument erected in Belgrade in over a century-long history of Freemasonry in our country. The fountain "At the Rough Stone" was accepted as a donation to Belgrade by the Municipality of Vraƒçar and the City Administration of Belgrade.
