## About Us

The Lodge Europe is a Freemasonic Lodge established in the Orient of Belgrade with the number 27, under the auspices of the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia, on October 3, 2009. The founding idea was to create a Lodge of young people who would embody the values of the European Union, aiming to bring Free Masons and citizens of Serbia closer, at a right angle, to a better future in a united Europe. The Lodge Europe operates according to the Ritual of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons (AF&AM). It is a member of the international chain of Lodges with the same name. It gathers every May within the International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) framework under the maxim "United in Diversity." Our gathering as Free Masons aims to preserve the fundamental values of civilization. The construction of man and humanity towards humanity is the essence of Freemasonry and our workshop, which strives to perform good deeds and assist society beyond the walls of Masonic Temples to the extent possible. Politics and religion are not discussed within the Lodge by the rules as old as Freemasonry itself. Every member of the Lodge is free to practice their beliefs and is accepted within the bounds of universal human values that Freemasons advocate, such as freedom, equality, and brotherhood among people of all races, creeds, nations, and sexual orientations. With faith in the Great Architect of All Worlds, we gather in the hope that our actions and the improvement of each member of the Lodge will make our society and the world a better and more humane place to live.


## About ISEL

The International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) is an international organization that brings together Lodges bearing the name "Europe" and operating under the auspices of Regular Grand Lodges. The first symposium, where ISEL was founded, was held in Riccione from May 9 to 11, 2008. Six Lodges from Italy, Austria, France, and Romania gathered on the initiative of the Brethren from Lodge Europe No. 765 in the Orient of Riccione. In the following years, new Lodges from other European countries joined, so today ISEL comprises over 20 Lodges from Italy, Austria, France, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, and Montenegro. Every year around May 9, Europe Day, member Lodges and invited ones gather at the symposium in one of the member countries. The next meeting place and the Lodge to host will be selected during the symposium. 
Symposium topics are related to the fundamental values nurtured by Freemasonry, current social issues within the European continent, and the exchange of experiences in Lodge’s work to improve operations in the vibrant world of the 21st century. In May 2013, Lodge Europe hosted the sixth International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) when it unveiled the fountain "At the Rough Stone" at Cvetni Trg (Flower Square) in Belgrade.


## About Regular Freemasonry

Freemasonry is described as a "system of moral values, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols." Since Freemasonry is a human creation composed of people and civilization values, every Brother is called to contribute to its development in their way and within the limits of their capabilities, discovering through this process what they carry within themselves. Regular Freemasonry officially began its organized activity by forming the Grand Lodge of England in London in 1717. Today, the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) is considered the "Mother Lodge," its recognition guarantees the regularity of Masonic obedience. The regularity that characterizes the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia is represented by international recognition from over 140 regular Grand Lodges worldwide and on all continents, led by the recognition of the United Grand Lodge of England. This is also confirmed by the recognition of the World Conference of Grand Lodges, which affirmed the continuity and heritage of the Grand Lodge of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes - "Yugoslavia" since its establishment in 1919. These recognitions ensure that the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia, led by the Most Worshipful Grand Master Lukas Rasulić, is the only sovereign, regular, and internationally recognized Masonic obedience in the Republic of Serbia. Within the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia, over 60 Freemasonic workshops operate according to the Ritual of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons (AF&AM), the Scottish Rite, and the Emulation Ritual (in English). Members of regular Freemasonic workshops are expected to be "free men of good report," to believe in the same God regardless of affiliation to any religion, and to promote throughout their lives the fundamental civilization values on which Freemasonry is based, namely freedom, equality, and brotherhood among people.


## Activities

Lodge Europe No. 27 in the Orient of Belgrade operates under the auspices of the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia and participates in many humanitarian activities within its parent organization. In addition, it regularly organizes several traditional activities carried out within the capabilities of its members on an annual basis. These include donations of clothing, food, hygiene products, medicines for the homeless and orphaned children, and books to local libraries in Belgrade and other places in Serbia. Lodge Europe also highlights that in May 2013, when it hosted the sixth International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL), it unveiled the fountain "At the Rough Stone" at Flower Square in Belgrade. This is the first official Masonic monument erected in Belgrade in over a century-long history of Freemasonry in our country. The fountain "At the Rough Stone" was accepted as a donation to Belgrade by the Municipality of Vračar and the City Administration of Belgrade.
