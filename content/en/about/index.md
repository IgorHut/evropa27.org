The Lodge Europe is a Freemasonic Lodge established in the Orient of Belgrade with the number 27, under the auspices of the Regular Grand Lodge of Serbia, on October 3, 2009. The founding idea was to create a Lodge of young people who would embody the progressive values of Europe, aiming to bring Free Masons and citizens of Serbia closer, at a right angle, to a better future in a united Europe. The Lodge Europe operates according to the Ritual of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons (AF&AM). It is a member of the international chain of Lodges with the same name. It gathers every May within the International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) framework under the maxim "United in Diversity." Our gathering as Free Masons aims to preserve the fundamental values of civilization. The construction of man and humanity towards humanity is the essence of Freemasonry and our workshop, which strives to perform good deeds and assist society beyond the walls of Masonic Temples to the extent possible. Politics and religion are not discussed within the Lodge by the rules as old as Freemasonry itself. Every member of the Lodge is free to practice their beliefs and is accepted within the bounds of universal human values that Freemasons advocate, such as freedom, equality, and brotherhood among people of all races, creeds, and nations. With faith in the Great Architect of All Worlds, we gather in the hope that our actions and the improvement of each member of the Lodge will make our society and the world a better and more humane place to live.
