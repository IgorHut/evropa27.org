      <description>The International Symposium of European Lodges (ISEL) is an international organization that brings together Lodges bearing the name &amp;ldquo;Europe&amp;rdquo; and operating under the auspices of Regular Grand Lodges. The first symposium, where ISEL was founded, was held in Riccione from May 9 to 11, 2008. Six Lodges from Italy, Austria, France, and Romania gathered on the initiative of the Brethren from Lodge Europe No. 765 in the Orient of Riccione. In the following years, new Lodges from other European countries joined, so today ISEL comprises over 20 Lodges from Italy, Austria, France, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, and Montenegro.</description>

      <description>Freemasonry is described as a &amp;ldquo;system of moral values, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.&amp;rdquo; Since Freemasonry is a human creation composed of people and civilization values, every Brother is called to contribute to its development in their way and within the limits of their capabilities, discovering through this process what they carry within themselves. Regular Freemasonry officially began its organized activity by forming the Grand Lodge of England in London in 1717.</description>
